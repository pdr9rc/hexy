Protected from the world by the bottomless Múr and three cyclopean bridges, its ruling merchant class feuds internally while King Sigfúm the Kind prepares its people for a prophesied mass death at Cliff Terion [1-3]. Established by travelers seeking a land free of religion, built atop an ancient, scrubbed cathedral structure, the city now struggles with lurking horrors and its own internal decay.",
