It is filled with mausoleums, blank-eyed cherubs, stagnant fountains, plague pits, and ordinary graves. The air here is heavy, stale, and difficult to breathe, often accompanied by the sound of frantic scratching. Rising above this mournful landscape is the gothic black castle known as the Palace of the Shadow King.",
