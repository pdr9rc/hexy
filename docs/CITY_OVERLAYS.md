# üè∞ City Overlays - The Dying Lands

## Overview

The City Overlays feature allows you to generate detailed 5x5 hex grids from city images, with each hex containing randomly generated content based on the M√∂rk Borg database. This feature expands the existing terrain analyzer code to work with urban environments.

## Features

- **Image-based Overlays**: Process any city image to create hex grids
- **5x5 Hex Grid**: Each overlay generates exactly 25 hexes arranged in a 5x5 grid
- **Random Tables**: Each hex has its own random encounter table based on M√∂rk Borg lore
- **ASCII Map View**: Visual representation of the city layout in ASCII format
- **Interactive Interface**: Click hexes to explore detailed content
- **Position-based Content**: Content varies based on hex position (edge, center, corner, inner)

## How to Use

### 1. Adding City Images

1. Place city images in the `data/city_overlays/` directory
2. Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`
3. Example files:
   - `image1.jpg` - Historical city map (provided as example)
   - `galgenbeck.jpg` - For the canonical M√∂rk Borg city

### 2. Accessing City Overlays

1. Start the server: `cd src && python3 ascii_map_viewer.py`
2. Open the web interface
3. Click the **üè∞ CITY OVERLAYS** button in the control panel
4. Select an available city overlay

### 3. Viewing Overlay Content

#### ASCII View
- Displays the entire 5x5 grid in text format
- Shows all hex details with descriptions and encounters
- Perfect for printing or text-based reference

#### Interactive Grid
- Click **üé≤ INTERACTIVE GRID** for the visual interface
- Click individual hexes to view detailed information
- Each hex shows:
  - Content type (District, Building, Street, etc.)
  - Description and encounter details
  - Random event tables
  - NPCs, treasures, and threats
  - Atmospheric details

## Content Types

### City Hex Content Types

| Symbol | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| D | District | Large areas with thematic content |
| B | Building | Individual structures |
| S | Street | Thoroughfares and pathways |
| L | Landmark | Important monuments |
| M | Market | Trading areas |
| T | Temple | Religious sites |
| V | Tavern | Drinking establishments |
| G | Guild | Professional organizations |
| R | Residence | Homes and dwellings |
| U | Ruins | Destroyed or abandoned areas |

### Position-based Generation

- **Edge Hexes**: Less developed, more residential/ruined
- **Corner Hexes**: Often fortified or defensive
- **Center Hex**: Most important, usually landmarks/temples
- **Inner Hexes**: Well-developed commercial/civic areas

## Random Tables

Each hex type includes specific random encounter tables:

### Example - Temple Random Table
```
1-2: The altar demands a sacrifice for a blessing
3-4: Hear confessions that reveal dark secrets
5-6: A divine vision shows you a possible future
7-8: The sacred texts rewrite themselves
9-10: A miracle occurs, but at a terrible price
11-12: The deity speaks directly to you
```

### Example - Market Random Table
```
1-2: A vendor offers to buy your memories
3-4: Find an item that shouldn't exist here
5-6: Witness a transaction in souls rather than coin
7-8: A merchant recognizes you from a dream
9-10: Discover the market exists in multiple realms
11-12: A purchase comes with an unexpected curse
```

## File Structure

```
data/city_overlays/              # City overlay images
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.jpg                   # Example historical map
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ galgenbeck.jpg              # Galgenbeck city (add your image)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_city.png               # Any additional city images

dying_lands_output/city_overlays/  # Generated overlay data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1_overlay.json         # Cached overlay data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ galgenbeck_overlay.json     # Generated when accessed

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ city_overlay_analyzer.py    # Main overlay processing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ascii_map_viewer.py         # Web interface integration
```

## Technical Details

### Grid System
- 5x5 grid (25 hexes total)
- Hex IDs: `{row}_{col}` (0_0, 0_1, ..., 4_4)
- Position types: edge, corner, center, inner

### Content Generation
- Uses existing M√∂rk Borg database tables
- Weighted content selection based on position
- Random tables generated per content type
- Position-specific modifiers applied

### Data Storage
- JSON files for generated overlays
- Cached for performance
- Regenerated if image changes

## Examples

### Galgenbeck Example

Create a `galgenbeck.jpg` image in `data/city_overlays/` and the system will automatically generate:

```
üè∞ GALGENBECK - THE CORPSE CITY
Grid Layout (5x5):
[R] [B] [S] [L] [R]
[D] [T] [M] [G] [D]
[B] [M] [L] [T] [S]
[R] [G] [M] [B] [R]
[U] [D] [S] [D] [U]
```

Each hex would contain detailed M√∂rk Borg-appropriate content like:
- **Temple of the Dying God** with blood offerings
- **The Bone Bazaar** trading in cursed relics
- **Corpse Quarter** district with plague-ridden inhabitants
- **Guild of Sacred Executioners** maintaining dark order

## Integration with Existing System

The city overlay system seamlessly integrates with:
- **Terrain System**: Uses same base infrastructure
- **M√∂rk Borg Database**: Draws from canonical lore
- **ASCII Map Viewer**: Shares interface patterns
- **Random Generation**: Uses existing table system

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python3 test_city_overlays.py
```

This will test:
- Image detection
- Overlay generation
- ASCII view creation
- Individual hex content
- Grid summary display

## Future Enhancements

Potential expansions of the city overlay system:
- Variable grid sizes (3x3, 7x7, etc.)
- Image analysis for automatic content placement
- Custom content tables per city
- Multi-level city maps (underground, etc.)
- Integration with existing hex map system
