You're looking for a comprehensive collection of random tables, complete with details and lore, to generate various aspects of a dark and dying world. This includes monsters, loot, NPCs, taverns, dungeons, world descriptions, locations, and travel encounters. Drawing on the provided sources, here's a detailed compilation of such tables and their associated lore:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General World & Setting Lore
The world is a bleak and brutal place, with the sun unseen for years, and doomsayers are often proved right
. Water is a form of wealth, as fire has boiled away springs and streams, making sky-borne water or "hot red stuff of life" the primary sources. Coins have no utility, and water is exchanged as wealth, with one day's worth valued at 20s
.
The Calendar of Nechrubel dictates prophecies of the apocalypse, such as the city being made hollow, the earth shaking to release poisonous mist, and flying spectres and crawling beasts emerging from the underworld
. The final psalm speaks of "Yetsabu-Nech, the underworld’s nightmare, the black disk which stands before the sun," "Verhu, beaming with delight," and "the fire which burns all" before darkness swallows darkness
.
Several notable regions and factions exist:
• The Ashen Sea: A central map location with various points of interest
. Boat travel is common, and daily encounters are rolled on a d100 table
.
• Galgenbeck - The Corpse City: A sprawling metropolis built on ancient bones, ruled by Arch-Priestess Josilfa Migol who enforces the Ordinance of Devotion. The Harvester delivers summons for sacrifice, causing the population to shrink daily to forestall a comet's destruction
. The air often tastes of bone dust and old blood, and soul extraction machines hum in the distance. Districts include Altmarkt and Rattingen, where humans fight rats for survival, and the streets may feature corruption, plague-ridden beggars, or bone grinding operations
.
• Kergüs: Home to Anthelia, Blood-Countess of Kergüs, who amuses herself with tournaments
.
• Sarkash: A vast forest of gloomy overgrowth and dread
. Travel through Sarkash is challenging, with thick, twisted wood and inhospitable conditions. The Black Salt Winds are linked to Sarkash, as are catacombs plagued by cannibalism
.
• Targ-Dungel: A region with factions like the Scions of Schleswig, the Mud Cult, and the Immortal Algae-Rots. It's described as a rot-bloated swamp
.
Factions & Affiliations
Factions are groups united by beliefs, origins, or a will to survive
.
Factions within the world:
• Ashmouth Raiders: A chaotic fusion of natural stone and repurposed organic materials, their fortresses serve as bazaars. They often have 2d20 Raiders willing to join as crew, selling most goods at double prices. Street violence is common and indiscriminate
. Their vessels vary wildly, captained by a Raider Leader with a crew of Raiders
.
• Bloodhunters: Sell information on the best places to hunt
. Their initiation, "Blooding," involves prospective members being cast into the "Clot" (a great pool of coagulating mixed blood beneath a mountain) and finding their way out. Many failed members remain trapped like "bugs in amber". They find religious ecstasy in the hunt and sell specialist hunting equipment, trackers, guides, and hunted results
.
• Burnt Offerings: Encountered as faction boats with crew
. They seek the "Revelations of Flame" found in everburning jars
.
• Cannibal Count: Located at Mount-Manse
. Orders from the Cannibal Count, years old, might address you by name and bid you to visit
.
• Pneumatic Order: A faction with specific units and vessels
. They value Captured Plasm of Beyond
.
• Urniversity: A faction whose scholars are ceaseless, often found dissecting subjects and turning them to the study of the Apocalypse in The Dome, a huge swollen balloon of architecture
. The Library, looming over other buildings, is only accessible from The Dome, filled with books and feral scribes. They offer o-books work. Offerings include weather-maps, archival research on ruined areas, and artifact identification. They practice "Committing of Knowledge," adding new information to their library. Notable scholars include Szilagyi (lectures endlessly), Lakatos (leaves sentences trailing), Kende (never satisfied), Illes (miserable), and Kis (treats everyone as a sibling). Scholars are "brightly coloured peacocks," their learning often useless. Field-Researchers are more practically minded, able to replicate random power effects by futzing with artifacts. Each vial of Ash in their Ash-Library is worth 3dw
.
• Heretical Clergy: A type of NPC affiliation
. The fort in Death's Fort is garrisoned by a strange heretical religion whose practices transformed it into a grotesque living mass
.
• Pale Ones: Four Pale Ones conduct strange experiments on lost souls in Sarkash. Nagl lives among them. They prize the Black Disc from The Crater

Each tower belongs to a Dry-Witch, consisting of 2d6 floors that refract and warp physical space. Their lair is a tangle of razor-sharp glass fragments, requiring Defense rolls to avoid damage.

Another, Eanflead, has 45 HP with "Armouring Words" (-d2) and "Fist-Smash" (2d10/d2 Structure damage).

Sandbox Generation Framework
A "sandbox" campaign allows players free choice within the setting
. It involves systematic generation of geography, locales, and NPCs
.
Process for Generating a Sandbox:
1. Sketch a world/continent map, label regions, and write a one-page background for each
.
2. Pick a main campaign region (e.g., 200x150 miles), draw a hex map, add mountains, rivers, hills, and vegetation
.
3. Place Population Locales (settlements), Lairs (monster homes), Ruins, and other miscellaneous locales
.
4. Name geography (including islands)
.
5. Write paragraphs describing the region, geography, locales, and lairs
.
6. Develop 2-4 plots tying locales together
.
7. Create 3-5 encounters for each population locale, and 6-12 general encounters for the region
.
8. Draw sketch maps for important population locales, and a full-page map for the starting "Home Base"
.
9. Detail buildings and notable NPCs/monsters with blurbs and stats
.
10. Identify regional organizations and stat out common encounters
.
11. Create a rumor chart (10-20 items leading to encounters/plots)
.
12. Create random encounter charts for major regions (monsters, wildlife, NPCs)
.
Hex Map & Biomes:
• Biomes: Grassland, Forest, Hills, Marsh, Mountains
. Can be expanded by generating layers
.
• Encounters per Biome: Different monster types are associated with each biome (e.g., Dinosaurs in Grassland, Ents in Forest, Manticores in Hills, Moth-men in Marsh, Giants in Mountains)
.
• Features: Prominent things inside hexes (Landmark, Settlement, Lair, Dungeon)
.
• Random Encounters (Hex): Can involve Dragons, other factions, current hex's faction, NPCs, or biome-specific monsters
.
Landmarks:
• Types: Natural, Artificial, Magic
.
• Content: Can be a Hazard (dangerous), Empty (info about world/inhabitants), Special (mystery/event with reward), or contain Monsters
.
• Hazards: Acid pits, allergenic plants, illness, curse, dangerous footing, easy to get lost, fog, fumes, ghosts, hallucinogenic spores, hidden pits, hunting traps, magic corruption, plague, quicksands, radiations, sabotage/trap, unstable, venomous animals, volcanic area
.
• Empty Landmark Info: Info about nearby monsters, alchemy recipe, curative effects, directions, dungeon location, future event, past event, legend/myth, local custom, password, secret passage, spell/ritual, magic weapon tale, toxicity, upcoming weather, monster language words
.
• Special Landmark Events: Arbitrate dispute, prevent threat, solve puzzle/riddle, uncover mystery, NPC(s)/Monster(s) in need, or related to the landmark (e.g., evil ceremony, flood, frenzied animals, magic corruption, plague, wildfire)
.
Adventures at Sea:
• Sea Hexes: External hexes are empty. Central hexes can contain Nothing, a Landmark, or an Island
.
• Maritime Landmarks: Active underwater volcano, Buoy, Coral reef, Giant animal skeleton, Iceberg, Natural stone arch, Permanent fog, Regatta course, Sandbar, Sunk galleon, Underwater grotto, Whirlpools
.
• Island Types: Atoll, Jungle, Rocky, Volcanic
.
This framework, combined with the detailed tables and lore, offers a robust system for generating a unique and immersive dying world.
