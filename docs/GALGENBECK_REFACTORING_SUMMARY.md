# DEVOTION
Groveling for redemption. Sacrificed for naught.
The rot of Galgenbeck.
Release of death; the scum escapes.
mired in Unterwelt. Eternally until the new cycle.
Josilfa reaps. Nechrubel smiles from horn to horn.
The millstone grinds his luncheon.

**Population:** ~120.000
**Trend:** Shrinking
**Government:** Theocracy

### Wealthy City Districts
* **Cathedral's Shadow:** Small district with a market (luxury goods, palatable food). Oldest district surrounding the Cathedral. Home to religious elite and pious nobility (filthy rich merchants who funded construction). Armed guards keep the peace, beating and fining lower-standing Galgenbeckians without a Holy Summons.
* **Ehrenfeld:** Circular district enclosing Cathedral's Shadow. Houses lower church echelons and considerable wealth. Stoic guards keep rabble out of houses.
* **Lärchengrund:** Living space for the middle-class. Specialty craftspeople (dressmakers, confectioners, poodle parlors). Notaries, lawyers, physicians, engineers. Known for Galgenbeck University of All-Embracing Knowledge (required for many professions). Many practitioners of arcane arts (magic healing, talking to the dead).

### Piss Poor City Districts
* **Neu Kürk:** Shunned craftspeople and artists flock here (abattoirs, tanners, colorful ateliers). Low rents due to stink. Many starve. Corpse collectors roam polluted gutters.
* **Riverside:** District of hard workers and excessive entertainment. Warehouses line riverfront, seedy joints further inland (knocking shops, taverns for dockworkers). Rank with thieves and soldiers of fortune. Lawlessness decreased since Ordinance of Devotion.
* **Chalk:** Heavy industry district, colored black. Cannon foundries never tire.
* **Downwind:** Proper poor neighborhood transitioning into a sprawling slum. Warlords carved it up, engage in border conflicts. Shady businesses pop up quickly. Unlicensed physicians, rusty knife haircuts. Network of beggars share street knowledge for silver. Good for getting mugged or buying a used kidney.
* **Rattingen:** Less a district, more a pool of unfiltered carnage. Humans fight rats for survival (rats eat men, men eat rats). Fighting in streets, hail of arrows from rooftops, fires. Rat trappers catch humans, human trappers grind rats. Palisade holds back rats, single gatehouse for entry. Knights intensely examine those leaving for hidden rats (some burrow into skull to operate corpses). Gatehouse built over Flesh-tunnels of Kerlin, where rats are stuffed.

### Lost Places
1.  **Curse Murk (cidi idi oc veni v):** Lies below a decrepit factory. Created by nechrotects to slurp negative energy. Nearing critical capacity; will explode, releasing centuries of curses and demon muck. All original nechrotects but one (the immortal beggar Ulf) have turned to dust. Ulf has forgotten all and assaults passersby to drag them into the murk.
2.  **Puppet Factory:** Once famous for creepy children's toys, closed after puppets became sentient and massacred owners. Abandoned factory achieved sentience, now constructs puppets of mass destruction and expands itself. Adventurers attacking it only add more construction materials. Beware the puppets.
3.  **Sooty Hospital:** Abandoned grimy healing place in Chalk, all healers died during Year of Purple Tears plague. Recently rediscovered by heretic necromancers. They reconstitute dead laborers to sell them as indentured servants to factories to pay medical bills from involuntary revival. Use special pathogens for "improvements" (bigger muscles, tinier brains).
4.  **Quixotic Dynamo (in the White Múr):** A sizable steel waterwheel powers the Dynamo in a ruined temple, a pilgrimage site for electric wickheads. They plug in to recharge and experience ecstasy, but risk burning out. Fishers also killed by dynamo overloads. Dynamo recently started overwriting wickheads' souls with dark, subconscious missions.
5.  **The Kennel:** Subterranean tavern and inn for Galgenbeck’s earthbound. Avoids light. Overwhelming stench of wet dog. Recruiters seek desperate individuals for suicide missions. Offers: dog fights, tattoos, piercings, canine doom metal, gambling, bloodletting, massages, burlesque entertainment. Proprietor: Luna, of the 7th generation.
6.  **Secret Prison (As so lies underneath the courthouse.):** The most disgusting prison. Houses schismatics and pan-organs. Simple holes filled with unspeakable waters where prisoners drown.
7.  **The Restaurant:** Tightly kept secret among the rotten elite. Offers every culinary depravity imaginable at high prices. Booked out until the end of days, but mercenaries who "hunt game" often get a spot and a hearty meal on the house. Cook is Poison Ivy. Proprietor unknown.
8.  **Dripstone Cave:** Famous tourist magnet below Lärchengrund. Became too unsafe due to attacks by robbers, cultists, cannibals, etc. Now, cultists lair there, breeding the yellow blob (brainless but highly intelligent matter). The blob probes Galgenbeck, extending its plasmodium into mansions, pets, and people, feeding and learning. Cultists reshaped by blob's influence.

### Rumors (d12)
Words travel from mouth to mouth. They tell of truths or lies, but all hold a grain of hate.

| d12 | Rumor                                                                     |

| 3   | “The washer Mathilde Radzun hasn't stopped dancing in days. Now more people have joined. Some keeled over and died in the gutter.” |

| 5   | “Nothing helps against baldness, ingrown nails, and wild flesh like Harry Hilbert's Wonder Tonix. Drop by the shop today to get your free sample!” |
| 6   | “The butcher Otto Altman had three children. Nobody has seen them for weeks, but his meat counter is abundantly filled.” |
| 7   | “You won't believe it, but Amalia Winter has the corpse of her husband hidden beneath the floorboards. She claims he's off to some war to collect a grass widow's rent. But she's not fooling me!” |
| 8   | “Old Minna's sheep gave birth to a two-headed lamb! I'm telling you, she's a dirty heretic. Why else would she mock the great basilisks like that? I'm going to rat her out for a fine sum.” |
| 9   | “They finally threw the lowlife Trebor the Red in prison. His thieving days are over. They never found his treasure though.” |
| 10  | “Kalli the bricklayer claims to have seen a headless man walking in the street. Not only that, apparently the thing was using its organs as a bloody bagpipe.” |
| 11  | “They say the world is going to end. But my fortune teller Cristobal the Expanded promised me great riches in the future. So, I think nothing is going to happen. Right?" |
| 12  | "Somebody goes around Galgenbeck poisoning the scarce food we have left. A hundred silver for the söldner who puts a sword through their throat." |

### Quest Seeds
1.  **MLM (multi-level murdering):** Lambert is an aspiring entrepreneur who ransacked and killed dozens of farmers. He seeks downline distributors (to sell goods) and murderers (to get more goods). Characters can earn a share if they join early. Lambert has excellent intel. He lives above a questionable brothel, moving to fancier places. His warehouse is filled with preserved food, furniture, junk. If not stopped, the city descends into an exponential murder spree.
2.  **DANCING PLAGUE:** Cobbler Agnes Bundschuh poisoned wells with ergot fungi (crates have Nagel Krat's sigil). Motive: profit (dancers need shoes; she makes shoes from corpses). Clues: dead wear her shoes, new shoes taste human, Krat's store manifesto. Agnes's shop is booby-trapped with nail-laced stun powder. If suspected, she blows up shop and flees to a safe house in Brown Town (sewers).
3.  **MYSTERY MEAT:** Restaurant chef Ferdinand (Cedar Grill, Lärchengrund) stole corpses to make Galgenburgers. Customers eating them develop a taste for humans and turn into zombies in d6 days. Clues: half-eaten Galgenburger, Cedar Grill pamphlet, secret recipe on napkin.
4.  **FORESIGHT:** Great Augur Mysteria can predict future with cursed deck. Deck doesn't foretell, it causes mischief. Prices steep, lusts for body parts, memories, names. Mysteria knows a Power to convert anything into pure pleasure. A character having future predicted will soon (d4): 01 Die of horrible disease. 02 Lose one or more limbs. 03 Lose somebody dear. 04 Lose important item. DESTROY THE DECK OF CARDS TO PREVENT THE FORETELLING!

### Encounters (General/Arcane)
1.  **Enochian Syntax:** Murderous Arlbarg uses Enochian Syntax to make people jump to their death from Old Basilika bridge. Sits disguised as leper beggar. If not stopped, escalates to: 1) Cast Death in Altmarkt on busy market day. 2) Cast Palms open the Southern Gate to set black powder storage on fire. 3) Cast Foul Psychopomp during a funeral. When confronted, screams: “It’s what my character would do!”
2.  **In Chains:** Man in chains captures humans to pay the Old One (ancient creature in Undercity, page 42) for knowledge. Old One strings him along. Why he seeks knowledge (d3): 1) Nightmare creatures abducted family; needs to know if alive, where, how to free. 2) Lover turned into goblin; needs cure before others notice screams. 3) Seeks ultimate Power (lichdom).
3.  **Jelle the Power Pig:** University researchers tattooed Powers onto Jelle, their research pig, who escaped. Jelle has Endless Bacon (Test DR15 Presence or turn into pig. New pig can use Endless Bacon). Statisticians believe 100% of Galgenbeck will be pig in d6 days. Reward: 1,000 silver. Jelle wants world to burn.
4.  (Missing content here - implied a table for gargoyles/pale ones based on subsequent text.) The gargoyles were ancient pale ones turned to statues 600 years ago. Magic worn off, returned to pseudo-flesh. Plot in darkness. After d6 day breeding cycle, will kill and replace dignitaries with offspring. **ANCIENT PALE ONE:** HP 20, Morale 8, Unarmed d2.

## The Absolute State
Half of Galgenbeck's population is gone, mostly to Josilfa's scythe. The city seems empty, but nobody notices. Galgenbeck was always half empty. People remember those who died by their own hands (hanged, clubbed, drowned). Accused heretics are on hard times. Josilfa Migol issued Ordinance of Devotion to quell unrest and defeat the comet's omen. Heralds nailed pamphlets to doors and trees (the same trees where people hang). Law-abiding citizens received it well. Every day, the Harvester delivers summons to elected sacrifices, hunting and decapitating non-compliers.

### Ordinance of Devotion
"To all people of Galgenbeck. The darkest times are upon us. - "The city shall be made hollow. Of those who rest in hollowness, they shall not be seen." - To forestall the destruction of our glorious city, I hereby issue this terrible ordinance."
1.  ¶ You shall not string up your fellow citizens in righteous fury.
2.  ¶ You shall report all suspected heretics to the holy authorities. Consider heretics those who lie, steal, summon devils, or have an evil air about them.
3.  ¶ You shall not offer food or shelter to known or suspected heretics, criminals, and rioters.
4.  ¶ Until such time that the comet has passed us by, you shall return to your home and pray. You shall only leave to gather your necessities.
5.  ¶ You shall offer your body and soul for deliverance of Galgenbeck.
    * Her Most Holy Josilfa Migol

### NECHRUBEL'S HARVESTER
**HP** 77, **MORALE** 11, **NO ARMOR**, **SCYTHE** d12
**SPECIAL: RECKLESS CHARGE**
The Harvester charges toward an enemy and tests DR5. On a success, deals an additional 2d6 damage. On a failure, falls from horse, takes d6 damage, can't use Reckless Charge again.
*Immortal incarnation of death. Hides in Josilfa's scythe when not hunting/delivering summons. If killed, turns into dark fog and returns to Cathedral. To truly end: break the SCYTHE and defeat it with no place to flee. Only then will memories of the dead return, and the comet vanish.*

### Cathedral
* Massive structure at heart of Galgenbeck, from where Josilfa enacts justice.
* Last step of journey to break curse.
* Priests welcome visitors/summons. Characters must venture deep underground.

### Establishments (Popular Locations)

#### Lotta Gravy

* Offers chunky stew and hearty ale. Lotta is disturbingly thin due to worm infestation.
* Pays "ingredient hunters" for rats, mushrooms, pigeons, cats.

## ADVENTURE!

### [1] The Lost Friend
* Leopold (painter, tattoo artist) is characters' oldest friend.
* Adventure begins with SCYTHE severing Leopold's head, erasing his existence/memories.
* Characters find Leopold's letter, signed by "Leopold" (whom they don't remember). Letter has hints.
* Characters find Emma and Till (Leopold's children) outside their home, hungry/confused. They don't recognize characters and claim to have always lived alone.
* Inside home, find portrait of Leopold and children, and Leopold's diary (talks about unnatural things, paintings for people he's never seen, ledger full of unknown people, comet, possible Worm Sorcerer connection).
* Harvester serves summons later.

### [2] Holy Summons
* Adventure begins on Galgenbeck marketplace, talking with Leopold under Borkenbom (possibly for tattoo).
* HARVESTER interrupts, hands characters and Leopold their summons, whispers "Don't be late."
* Leopold disturbed by summons/Ordinance of Devotion. Invites characters to his home to discuss next steps.
* *Note: Characters receive summons regardless. If ignored, Harvester collects personally.*

### Enter Leopold's Studio
* Leopold's letter or invitation leads characters here. If by invitation, Leopold tells them to go to sewers for Worm Sorcerer.
* **The Lost Friend (Leopold is dead and forgotten):**
    * Neighbors, friends, kids forgotten him.
    * Children (Emma & Till) are orphans, asking for food/coin.
    * Children recognize characters or not, based on backstory.
    * Children claim to have always lived alone; mother Ella died after Till's birth; no father.
    * Inside home, characters find a portrait of Leopold and children ("little something" from letter).
    * Characters find Leopold's diary: "Something unnatural is afoot in Galgenbeck. I have finished paintings waiting in my gallery for people I have never seen. I checked my ledger. There are dozens of people in there I don't know about. That damned comet must have something to do with it. I'll write a letter to my old friends. They'll help. Hopefully. I also remember that I once tattooed an old man. He told me secrets about myself I had long ago forgotten. I fear it might have been the Worm Sorcerer. Maybe he has his pockmarked hands in this as well."
    * *Don't forget that the Harvester serves the characters their summons at an (inconvenient) later point!*

### Holy Summons (Content of the summons letter)
In the name of Arch-Priestess Josilfa Migol, you are ordered to appear in the Cathedral of the Two-Headed Basilisks for your sacrifice in seven days on the fourteenth of Yura. Use the remaining time to bring your affairs in order and praise HER.

### Leopold's Letter (Content of the letter)
Dear friends,
I know that I already owe you several favors, but I have to call on you again. Strange things are happening right under my nose, and I'm afraid for the family. Can you visit me in Galgenbeck, either at my regular spot under the Borkenbom or in my workshop? I don't remember if you've already been to my new place, it's in Neu Kürk. Search on Weaverstreet, right next to the chapel.
Looking forward to seeing you again!
Leopold
PS: I have prepared a little something for you.

### Into the Sewers (d8 Encounters)
To find the Worm Sorcerer, characters must encounter the sewer's evil. (Finding a sewer entrance is no challenge, they are around every corner).

| d8 Roll | Encounter                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | **Bacteria Colony:** A colony of sentient bacteria the size of a cow calls out to characters, needing feeding. For every corpse thrown into goo, receive (potable) excretions that heal 1 HP. |

### Worm Sorcerer

**WHO IS THIS CREEP?** Dirty throat slitter who escaped justice by slipping into sewers. Found safety and enlightened parasites. Worms crawled into his ears, shared unclean secrets, tingling awake his slumbering talents.
"The worms whisper their tiny secrets into my ears. Oh, the things I know. Oh, the things I wish I didn’t know.”
Visits markets/wells by day, spreading eggs and stealing rotten food. Floats in sewer waters at night for worms to bathe. Worms want to spread, procreate, infect. They rummage in brains, plow through bowels. Hatchlings return to sewers, sharing learned secrets. Wonders why fewer children return.

**STATISTICS:**

* **Morale** 6
* **No armor**
* **Dagger** d4 + SPECIAL
