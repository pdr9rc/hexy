# Research: Improvements to Existing Lore and Tables
## Hexy - Dying Lands Hexcrawl Generator

**Research Date:** January 2025  
**Project:** Hexy - M√∂rk Borg Hexcrawl Generator  
**Focus:** Enhancing existing lore database and content tables

---

## üìä Current System Analysis

### Existing Strengths
- **Comprehensive lore database** with 6 major cities, regional biases, and hardcoded locations
- **Extensive content tables** with bilingual support (EN/PT)
- **Modular table system** organized by categories (dungeon, bestiary, loot, etc.)
- **Terrain-aware generation** with biome-specific content
- **Strong M√∂rk Borg atmosphere** maintained throughout

### Identified Gaps
- **Limited post-2020 official content** integration
- **Static faction relationships** without dynamic evolution
- **Basic interconnected storylines** between hexes
- **Limited weather and seasonal effects**
- **Minimal third-party supplement integration**

---

## üè∞ Lore Database Improvements

### 1. Official Content Integration

#### New Official Entities from Recent Supplements
Based on recent M√∂rk Borg releases like "Ikhon" (2024):

**Forgotten Gods (Profane Profound)**
```python

        'plague_bearers': ['0615-0720', '1820-2025']   # Western and southern areas
    },
    'influence_strength': {
        'dominant': 0.8,    # Faction controls 80% of encounters
        'strong': 0.6,      # 60% control

## üîß Technical Implementation Suggestions

### 1. Database Schema Enhancements

#### Relational Data Structure
```python
class FactionInfluence:
    hex_code: str
    faction_name: str
    influence_level: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    last_updated: datetime
    trigger_events: List[str]

class HexConnection:
    hex_a: str
    hex_b: str
    connection_type: str  # 'trade_route', 'tunnel', 'mystical', 'political'
    active: bool
    story_significance: str

class DynamicEvent:
    event_id: str
    affected_hexes: List[str]
    duration_days: int
    effects: Dict[str, Any]
    triggers: List[str]
```

### 2. Content Generation Algorithms

#### Weighted Content Selection
```python
def generate_context_aware_content(hex_code, surrounding_hexes, faction_influence, calendar_state):
    """Generate content that considers broader context."""
    
    base_weights = get_base_content_weights(terrain_type)
    
    # Adjust for faction influence
    for faction, influence in faction_influence.items():
        if influence > 0.5:
            base_weights = apply_faction_modifier(base_weights, faction)
    
    # Adjust for calendar events
    if calendar_state.is_misery_active():
        base_weights = apply_misery_modifier(base_weights, calendar_state.current_misery)
    
    # Adjust for neighboring hex content
    for neighbor_hex in surrounding_hexes:
        neighbor_content = get_hex_content(neighbor_hex)
        base_weights = apply_proximity_modifier(base_weights, neighbor_content)
    
    return select_weighted_content(base_weights)
```

---

## üìä Content Quality Metrics

### 1. Narrative Coherence Scoring
- **Faction Consistency**: Do generated NPCs align with regional faction presence?
- **Environmental Logic**: Are beasts appropriate for their terrain?
- **Story Connectivity**: Do nearby hexes reference each other appropriately?

### 2. Atmospheric Maintenance
- **M√∂rk Borg Tone**: Maintain grimdark, metal aesthetic throughout
- **Doom Progression**: Content becomes bleaker as apocalypse approaches
- **Player Agency**: Ensure meaningful choices despite grim setting

## üìñ Conclusion

The Hexy project has established an excellent foundation for M√∂rk Borg hexcrawl generation. These improvements focus on enhancing the existing systems with:

1. **Deeper Integration** of recent official and community content
2. **Dynamic Systems** that respond to player actions and campaign progression
3. **Interconnected Narratives** that create more meaningful exploration
4. **Enhanced Atmospheric Consistency** maintaining the grimdark aesthetic

The proposed improvements maintain the project's core strengths while addressing identified gaps, ensuring the generator remains true to the M√∂rk Borg vision while providing richer, more connected content for players and GMs.
